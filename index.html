  <h1>Thought Games</h1>

  <h2>Synopsis</h2>

  <p>A chance to unleash your mind, free of intent and judgement, to explore topics bound and unbound, furthering perspectives and hopefully revealing the nature of thought.

  <p>Thought Games is an amateur-run meetup and organisation with the goal of facilitating open discussion on a range of topics, from the wildly absurd to the insanely quotidian. Examples of on-topic discussions would be:

  <ul>
    <li>The diplomatic implications of a nation-bound zombie apocalypse 
    <li>The technological singularity and how it will affect humankind’s social nature
    <li>The ethical ramifications of uneaten toast in Britain
    <li>The practice of animal husbandry, framed as a moral dilemma
    <li>The human species, as viewed through the eyes of a type III civilization
  </ul>

  <p>Thought Games is considered by its creators as a “debating club designed for calm adults” discussing ideas of “utmost intrigue, hilarity and gravity”.

  <p>The meetups themselves are orchestrated through a series of concept games that drive participants towards new conceptual discoveries and formations.

  <p>What is not served by currently existing meetups?

  <p>To our eyes, there is nothing that facilitates discussions that are:

  <ul>
    <li>Unbound by the conventional academic or societal zeitgeist of our time
    <li>Flexible towards both hilarity and solemnity, on a variety of topics
    <li>At their core, non-confrontational and free of political, religious and societal impositions
  </ul>
